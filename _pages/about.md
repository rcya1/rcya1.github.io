Hi, I'm Ryan! I'm currently attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology double majoring in computer science and math with a minor in economics. I attended Union County Magnet High School from 2017-2021.

Besides computer science, I'm also interested in math, robotics, playing video games, building / programming random hobby projects, solving Rubik's cubes, and much more!

## Experience

### Software Engineering Internship at Conservation X Labs (January 2022)

Developed the frontend dashboard for [Sentinel](https://conservationxlabs.com/sentinel), a device that uses artificial
intelligence to recognize animal species for conservation efforts. The device plugs into existing camera hardware and runs customizable machine learning models on the field to analyze images and send that data over the cloud to conservationists. I worked with React, Redux, MUI, MySQL, Firebase, Figma, and Stripe in a team of 4 people for a month.

### Clubs

- Arcturus Autonomous Boat Team: Path Planning and State Estimation Lead
  - Responsible for developing algorithms to estimate the current position and velocity of our boat so it can plan and execute paths around obstacles to complete tasks for the Roboboat competition. Worked extensively with Robot Operating System (ROS), Ardupilot, and the Pixhawk flight controller.
- Battlecode Competition
  - Develop infrastructure and game for the annual Battlecode competition hosted by MIT where teams from around the world write AI players to compete in a tournament for cash prizes. See [the Battlecode website](https://battlecode.org/) for more details.

## High School

### Research at Stevens Institute of Technology

During the summers of 2018-2020, I was a research intern at the Life and Light Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken. While there, I helped write an algorithm for performing atmospheric correction on ocean satellite data, which helps calculate valuable parameters such as chlorophyll concentration and aerosol optical depth. The algorithm used machine learning, and it offered great improvements in accuracy over the widely used SEADAS algorithm developed by NASA while being just as fast.

I presented my work at the Liberty Science Center during the Partners in Science Symposium to around a hundred researchers in the NJ / NY area. I was also a co-author of the following paper:

[Fan, Y., W. Li, N. Chen, J.-H. Ahn, Y.-J. Park, S. Kratzer, T. Schroeder, J. Ishizaka, R. Chang, and K. Stamnes, OC-SMART: 
A machine learning based data analysis platform for satellite ocean color sensors, Remote Sensing of Environment, Volume 253, 2021, 112236, ISSN 0034-4257](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003442572030609X)

### Math Awards

- USAMO qualifier in 2021
- AIME qualifier in 2019, 2020, and 2021
  - Score of 14 in 2021
- ARML 2019 - 3rd place team in B division (member of Central Jersey B1 team)
- ARML Local 2020 - Tied for 13th place individually
- Helped write problems and solutions for the Hallowâ€™s Eve Online Math Tournament (HEOMT)
  - Sponsored by companies such as Wolfram, Jane Street, and 1Password to offer over $1000 in prizes to ~100 participants

### Competitive Programming Awards

- USA Computing Olympiad Platinum Division
- Qualified for Google Code Jam Round 2 in 2021

### Software Lead on FRC Robotics Team 1257

I organized a subteam of 15+ programmers to program a new robot every year for the First Robotics Competition. No experience was required for new recruits, and I taught the basics of Java and robotics programming throughout the fall. During the spring build season, I delegated tasks for the project and researched advanced path following, vision, and autonomous algorithms. During competitions, I drove the robot during matches and helped debug it. I wrote a [public training curriculum](https://frc1257.github.io/robotics-training/#/) for any programming team that was interested in learning how to get started in FRC.

### Science Olympiad

- 3rd place at 2018 NJ state competition in Game On
- 4th place at 2020 NJ state competition in Codebusters
- Multiple other medals at regional competitions
