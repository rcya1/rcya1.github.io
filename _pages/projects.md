### LaTeX Matrix Generator

A quick tool I made for creating matrices in LaTeX for my 18.06 (Linear Algebra) class during my freshman fall semester at MIT. I tried using other tools online but found them not suiting my needs / workflow, so I quickly made this.

## Other

### OC-SMART Algorithm

Plugin implementing an algorithm for processing ocean satellite data using machine learning (made during internship at Stevens Institute of Technology). It offered great improvements in accuracy over the widely used SEADAS algorithm developed by NASA while still being fast.

### FRC Robotics Training

A publically available full guide to both Java and FRC programming for students participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition. It was originally geared towards my team, but has information that can be used by anyone. I was the original author, but it is currently being maintained by the software lead at 1257.
