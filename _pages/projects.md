A selection of the various projects I've worked on throughout my time during high school and college.

## Programming

### Year in Pixels Creator

Web app that allows users to keep track of their mood each day through colors on an intuitive grid interface. Built using React, Express, MongoDB, Node, Bootstrap, and Passport.

### Pure Pursuit Visualizer

Web app built for teaching students in high schoolâ€™s robotics team about a path following algorithm used by our robot. Helped familiarize students with how to tune the algorithm, its limitations, and how to implement it. Built using TypeScript, Bootstrap, Webpack, and p5.js.

### LaTeX Matrix Generator

A quick tool I made for creating matrices in LaTeX for my 18.06 (Linear Algebra) class during my freshman fall semester at MIT. I tried using other tools online but found them not suiting my needs / workflow, so I quickly made this. It doesn't work very well with small screens since I made it for my personal laptop, but I'll try to fix it in the future. Built using React and Bootstrap.

### FIRST Infinite Recharge Simulation Game

A game I made for my high school junior year programming class where each player controls a robot in a simulated version of the FIRST Robotics Competition game from 2020. Built using Processing and Box2D.

## Other

### OC-SMART Algorithm

Plugin implementing an algorithm for processing ocean satellite data using machine learning (made during internship at Stevens Institute of Technology). It offered great improvements in accuracy over the widely used SEADAS algorithm developed by NASA while still being fast. See the [About Me](https://ryan10145.github.io/about/#internship-at-stevens-institute-of-technology) section for more details about the research internship and what the algorithm does.

### FRC Robotics Training

A publically available full guide to both Java and FRC programming for students participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition. It was originally geared towards my team, but has information that can be used by any team. I was the original author, but it is currently being maintained by the software lead at 1257.
